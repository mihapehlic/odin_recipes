        <p>Now listen kid. You'll start doing pieces when you have your game down. By down i mean you know what you're doing. No rookie mistakes anymore.
            You should be breathing graffiti. You'll start by sketching your graffiti piece on a piece of paper. Study your letters and colors.
            <p>Get this stuff:
                <ul>
                    <li>4-5 different color spraycans</li>
                    <li>Different caps</li>
                    <li>Backpack/bag</li>
                    <li>Friend for a lookout</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Proceed by going to your spot that you observed before. Watch over your shoulders and have a friend to lookout for you.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start by doing the outlines</li>
                        <li>Fill in with different colors and gradients</li>
                        <li>Good steady outline with 3d or a shadow</li>
                        <li>Funky outlines</li>
                        <li>Fancy highlights</li>
                        <li>Finish with a good handstyle of your name</li>
                    </ol>
