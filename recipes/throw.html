        <h3>Throwup, but don't puke!</h3>
        <p>Now this is a little bit more serious than just a stupid tag. For a throwup you'll need some skills and bigger cojones, because adrenaline might kick in.
             There's a lot of kids doing toyish throwups. But this shit is the fundament of graffiti. <strong>Get your game straight!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>For a throwup you'll need:
            <ol>
                <li>Chrome spraycan</li>
                <li>Black spraycan</li>
                <li>Fatcap & NY cap</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Now find yourself some dirty old abandoned wall and start by doing the outline of your throwup with Chrome. Fill in the outlines with a Fatcap. Finish with a black outline and some shadows.
             If you're feeling frisky you can even add some white highlights.</p>
             <p>That's it kid. You Rock!</p>
