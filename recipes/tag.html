        <h3>How to do a tag!</h3>
        <p>First you need to get your handstyle down on paper. You must practice a lot, kid.
            Make sure your letters look good. When you're ready you can get on the streets. But be careful, it's better for you to do it at nighttime.
        </p>
        <p>What you'll need:
            <ul>
                <li>Some sort of a marker or a spraycan</li>
                <li>Black hoodie</li>
                <li>Cojones</li>
            </ul>
